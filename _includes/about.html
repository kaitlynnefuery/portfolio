                    <p>Developer + Designer hybrid with 3+ years experience developing websites and user interfaces
                      using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Working in a startup environment for 8 years allowed me to wear
                      many hats and have involvement in a wide range of positions. From this experience, I harnessed
                      my design background with a newfound love for developing usable web interfaces that guide
                      the user through the site and/or application.</p>
